## Technologic Stack

* Python: [Python 3.5.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-356/)

## Description

```text
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The smallest 6 digit palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers is 101101 = 143 x 707.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers which is less than N.
```

### Input Format

```text
First line contains T that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines, each containing an integer, N.
```

### Constraints

```text
1 <= T <= 100
101101 < N < 1000000
```

### Output Format

```text
Print the required answer for each test case in a new line.
```

### Sample Input 0

```text
2
101110
800000
```

### Sample Output 0

```text
101101
793397
```

### Explanation

```text
101101 is product of 143 and 707 and .
793397 is product of 869 and 913.
```
